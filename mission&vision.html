			<p>Things might have changed over the years, but we've never lost sight of the School's founding values and educational mission.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12">
			<p>Grand High School was founded in 1913 in Bridge of Allan, near Stirling, by a young teacher called Harry Riley.</p>
			<p>
				Riley, born in Bradford in 1888 of very humble parents, had ambitions to join the Royal Navy. However, a medical assessment found his colour-blindness and an alternative career in teaching followed.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12">
			<p>Qualifying through the LCP (Licentiate of the College of Preceptors), Riley began his teaching career in 1908 in a small private school, Kelvingrove, in Bridge of Allan. With this school’s closure and merger with another in the town a few years later, Riley quickly opted for a very dramatic change of course – to set up his own school aged just 25 and ‘do it his way’.</p>
			<p>
				Grand High School was therefore founded with seven boys in a house in Bridge of Allan, after Riley found financial backing from two of the boys’ parents. From his earliest days as Headmaster, Riley emphasised four key things:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Pupils should be known for who they are and as individuals.</li>
					<li>Education should be enjoyed and not a drudgery</li>
					<li>Education should be inclusive, and find character, talents and potential that was hitherto unknown.</li>
					<li>Hard work is essential if education is to be the improving and transforming force for good Riley believed it could be.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

		<p>
			Riley moved the School to its new site and opened the doors to what remains Strathallan School today, and we celebrate the centenary of that move in 2020-21.
